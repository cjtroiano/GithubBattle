React Tutorial Notes

javascrip this.
	implicit binding
		me.function()
			function will use this and
	explicit binding
		call()
			able to use this() but must explicitly pass other arguments.
		apply()
			like call but you can pass an array of arguments and it will unpack the array for you
		bind()
		like call, but it returns a function
		var newFN = fn.bind(obj, arg[1], arg[2])
		newFN()
	window binding
		is you call a function that uses this.whatever, and no object is on the left, it is automatically binded to the window object
		ex:
			var fn = function(){
				console.log(this.whatever)
			}
			fn() // returns undefined
			window.whatever = "yo"
			fn() // returns "yo"
		if you use strict mode inside the function, it will not bind to the window
			'use strict';
